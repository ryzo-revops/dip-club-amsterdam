                True wellbeing does not come from optimizing yourself. It comes from
                being with others. From moving your body through landscapes that existed
                long before you did. From cold water that reminds you that you are alive.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that humans are not separate from nature — we are nature. And
                the moment we forget that, we start to break. Slowly, quietly, in ways
                that no app or algorithm can fix.
              </p>
              <p>
                Modern life is a game designed by humans. If you do not see it, it will
                swallow you whole.

                We are living our lives through screens. We are fed information by
                algorithms that thrive on negative emotions — outrage, envy, anxiety.
                We scroll instead of walking. We consume instead of creating. We compare
                instead of connecting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our bodies were built to move through forests, swim in rivers, sleep under
                stars, and share meals with people we trust. Instead, we sit in climate-
                controlled rooms, eat food made in factories, and call a like from a
                stranger &ldquo;connection.&rdquo;
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not a technology problem. Technology is a tool. This is an
                awareness problem. Most people have simply forgotten what it feels like
                to be fully present in their body, in a place, with other people.
